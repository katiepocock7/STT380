For this problem we will be looking at the data in the hypodata.csv file.
Read the data into R.  
```{r}
hypodata <- read.csv('hypodata.csv')
glimpse(hypodata)
```

Find the mean, standard deviation, and standard error.
Assuming the data is normal, build a 99% (2-sided) confidence interval with the t distribution.
Next, use standard bootstrapping to build the 99% confidence interval.
Use the Bayesian bootstrapping to build the 99% confidence interval.
Plot a histogram of the simulations in (4) and (5).  Does it look like the simulated means fit a normal distribution?
How do the 3 confidence intervals compare?
Next, use both standard and Bayesian bootstrapping to build a 99% CI for the standard deviation.  Plot a histogram of each.  Is the graph symmetric or skewed?
